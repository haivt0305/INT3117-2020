## If you have **never** worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that **you** have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality)

- level 0, do chưa có nhiều kinh nghiệm.
