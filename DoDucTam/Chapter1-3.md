## Question 3: What do we mean by **level 3** thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk? What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

**Level 3** begins when the realization that testing can show the presence, but not the absence,  of the failures. so it led us to the fact that we are always incur risks. they may be small and consequences are not worth to notice but some are great and consequences catastrophic, whatever they take, they are still there. so all developers and testers want the same thing is to reduce risk and minimize it as much as possible.

Because of risk is always there and testing can show the presence, but not the absence, of failures so we can not reduce it into 0
