## Question 2: What is the difference between software fault and software failure?

+ Software failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to the requirements or another description of the expected behavior.
+ Software fault: A static defect in the software. This is the root cause of the failure.

> Software failure is the problem that we can see while running a software, but we don't know why it happened yet, so we have to find exactly what cause that problem, and this where we find the software fault.
