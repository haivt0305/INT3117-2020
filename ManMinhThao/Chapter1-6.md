## Question 6: If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think the company worked at?

My company is working at **Level 3** testing. Because the Testers and Devs work together very fluently without againsting each others. 

The Devs can also work as a Tester by using their own software and if any failure occur, a Dev can report it to the bug base of the company for other Devs can solve it. 

On the other hand, the leaders in my company are never a Tester. They might doing as a tester before, but their main jobs is a Developer, and the Tester team and Dev team is also still separated and Devs don't usually contact to Testers other than working.
