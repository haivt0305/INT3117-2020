## Question 1: What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)? 

+ In **Level 2** testing, the purpose is to show failures. Testers might enjoy finding problems, but Developers are just want everything to work fine, so Developers and Testers might against each other, and both Testers and Devs cannot sure if there is any failures left, and wonder if the software is very good or the testing is weak,... This leads to **Level 3** testing start.
+ In **Level 3** testing, we realize that the risk is always occur whenever we use the software. The risk might unimportant or very important, but we cannot find it all, so the main purpose now is both Testers and Developers work together to reduce the risk of using software as much as possible. Now the Testers and Devs are on the same "team", the organization can progress **Level 4** testing.
+ **Level 4** thinking defines testing as *a mental discipline that increases quality*. There are many ways to increase quality, and one of those is we can create tests that cause the software to fail. In this case, Testers can become the technical leaders of the project. They have the primary responsibility of measuring and improving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers.

> ### Conclusion:
> - Developers and Testers must work together in harmony.
> - Always have the mindset that risk is always occur in the software, no matter how many time you fix it, and your job is to reduce the risk as much as possible.
> - Testers can also technical experts that can lead a team.
