## 1. What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

A development organization, in order to move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality), needs to go through 2 stages of mindset transformation:
From level 2 to level 3: Having enough experience in finding errors and vulnerabilities of the software product, you understand that every software contains a certain amount of risk. And by using or hosting the product, you expose your users and organization to that risk, and the best you can do with your development/testing team is to mitigate that risk as much as possible. This mindset puts you in a position of humility instead of over confidence, you will always be looking for risks and mitigation to constantly improve your product instead of a perfect solution which will intimidate instead of inspiring you. Secondly,  your development and testing team need to reduce the unhealthy rivalry to unite under the higher goal of minimizing the product’s risks.
From level 3 to level 4: Once the developers and testers are united, the testers start thinking more broadly to the picture of the product and the users. You have to realize the purpose of the organization and the product and how your product is helping the company help the users. The testers will then know where they need to go and what they need to instruct the developers in order to steer the development process towards it.

## 2. What is the difference between software fault and software failure?

Software Fault: A static defect in the software
Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to the requirements or another description of the expected behavior.

The software failure is the behavior that manifests to the users which does not adhere to  the utility claim of the software, while the software fault is a mistake in the design or development of the software that go against the intention of the creators

## 3. What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

Having enough experience in finding errors and vulnerabilities of the software product, you understand that every software contains a certain amount of risk. And by using or hosting the product, you expose your users and organization to that risk, and the best you can do with your development/testing team is to mitigate that risk as much as possible.

The risks can be security vulnerability, unexpected software behavior, unexpected server error, unexpected workload that crash the server.. There are a lot of risks involved in developing and maintaining a software product, a substantial amount of them are external, that it is impossible to account for everyone of them and make a perfectly risk-free software.

## 5. Practice exercise

```text
(a) The stop conditional statement i > 0, the 0-th element will not be iterated through
```

```text
(b) Not causing error: Testcase x=[2,3,5]; y=3 //expected 1
```

```text
(c) Iterate through fault but not causing error state: x=[2,3,5]; y=2 //expected 1   result -1
```

```text
(d) Caused error, not failure: x=[2,3,5]; y=33333333333333
```

## 6. Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background

The team that I’m working at my company is at the maturity level 2 of software testing.
