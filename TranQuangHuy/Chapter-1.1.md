**1. What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?**

We have 3 factors that could help move from level 2 to level 4. First, we must have technical people good at testing, that is important because we can't test anything without any knowledge about testing. Second, testers and developers must have strong relationships, because we can't work well if we keep distance from each other. And finally is that leaders must have good management skills.
