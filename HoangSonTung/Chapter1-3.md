What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

The risk in here is wider, it could be some serious problems like compatible issues, misleading requirements, cost impact,... Because testing is a job to find out existing fault in the software, but not the risk.

Risk could not be reduced to 0, since we can't anticipated user behaviour or external impacts.
