What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

- Everyone have to prioitize software quality to the first
- We should have responsiblity to every software developing task, ready for failures
- Strictly connecting between developer team & tester team
- Unify the management process
