If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think the company worked at? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesnâ€™t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).

In my point of view, my company reached level 4 at testing:
1.  We have a plan testing every releases, divided to seperate tasks with clearly information, use cases
2.  Every developer commits have to be reviewed and including test case for testers
3.  Having experienced tester with many years
